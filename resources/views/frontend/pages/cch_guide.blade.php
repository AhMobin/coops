                                <p>You want to convert an existing multi-family housing facility to co-operative ownership.  This is what we need to help you:</p>
                                <p><b><u>This Conversion Guide is based on the normal HUD 213 Market Rate housing program; but, is also consistent with the requirements of most Banks and/or other Financing Facilities</u></b></p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li class="mb-2">Description of the apartments, at a minimum, by bedroom size, how many of  each size, present rent, description of equipment included in each (range, refrigerator, dishwasher, disposal, air conditioner, cable connection, etc.)</li>
                                    <li class="mb-2">Utilities, included in rent or individually metered; storage rooms if any, community facilities if any.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-2">If available, net SF of typical apartments and total SF for the entire complex.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-2">Exterior info:  total size of land in sf or acres; number of parking spaces, number of any carports and/or garages.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-2">Copy of a site plan or property survey if available, copy of unit and floor plans if  available, Some photographs of buildings......all this can be mailed.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-2">Current financials.  It would help if we had financials for two prior years as well.  Also. description of current status of mortgage financing if any.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-2">A statement of current ownership, when the property was built.</li>
                                    <li class="mb-2">Current condition.  Also, what you consider would be a reasonable price for selling the property "as is".  If there are any vacancies - how long vacant; and, if in rentable condition. <b><em>If you have a Capital Needs Assessment (CNA) that would be very helpful.</em></b></li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>And, if you have good City Hall or other strong political contacts (like the ones below) to assist the path of your project, your proposal may have a life of its own.</p>
                                <br>

                                        <p>When we have items l,2,4,6,7 and 8 in hand, we should be able to draft the financial part of an Application for review.  If and when that analysis makes sense to you and is acceptable, we will try to locate (identify) a co-op friendly bank or other financial institution that may be interested in Community Development.</p>
                                        <p>We need at least a letter from a proposed lender showing interest in providing the anticipated "market rate multi-family mortgage" that (we) expect to secure Insurance and appropriate Guarantees.</p>
                                        <p>CCH/TCI can/will provide drafts or samples of basic co-op documents including an Information Bulletin (which will be based on an FHA Model Form) that can be used to explain to all parties, including existing tenants how the co-op conversion would function.</p>
                                        <p>The price for this service will be based on the size of the proposed project; and, how much of the Membership Organization and, or Management Supervision you might wish CCH/TCI to undertake.</p>
                                        <p>You are not alone.  Some believe “everyone should be permitted to share a portion of the American Dream” -to own a piece of the Rock -America.”  CCH/TCI/ and associate, Jobs Build America has partnered with Waste Technologies LLC to create a new generation of employment opportunities related to housing communities (co-ops) developed with Rosendale guidelines and principles in mind.</p>

                                <p>Neighborhood employment has been established as a high priority.   The President of Waste Technologies Dr. Moinuddin Sarker, PhD, has been elected to Vice President positions on the Boards of CCH and TCI.  Waste Technologies will not interfere with any current employment arrangement. However, Waste Technologies has created a new technology and will train new employees in new job position.</p>
