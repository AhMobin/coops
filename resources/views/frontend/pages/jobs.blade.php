                                employment. Yes, tenants and neighbors have always been encouraged to seek employment; but
                                recently, CCH, TCI and associates have become even more aggressive in their search for or
                                creation of more opportunities to help clients and their neighbors become more productive.</p>

                            <p>These sample projects indicate City, State and tenant involvement in addressing the variety of
                                challenges facing families of low and modest income and the common solutions we have applied
                                to help provide clean, safe, sanitary shelter at a price a family of limited income can afford to pay.
                                Co-op Housing is good for America. Co-ops practice and promote democratic principles (one
                                family, one vote) in all matters that come before the community for action including budget and
                                management.</p>

                                <li>Co-ops are race and color blind. See Jim

                            <p>Knowledge gained from more than fifty (50) years of coordination, organization and management
                                experience have convinced CCH/TCI and associates that the American Dream of “Home
                                Ownership” can be shared with all citizens, no matter how poor, if we follow the concept offered
                                by the popular entertainer, James Brown, in one of his most popular recordings. Mr. Brown, in
                                the clearest English stated; “Don’t want nobody tuh’ give me nothing. Just open up the door. I’ll
                                get it for myself.” The conversion of select multi-family and other distressed properties to tenant
                                ownership meets that test by allowing the American Dream to be experienced by more families
                                than ever before -without a single dollar ($) increase of financial support from any Federal, State
                                or City source.</p>

                            <p>Although the cost of membership compares favorably with security deposits charged in most
                                rentals, Co-op Members begin to enjoy equity benefits during each month of occupancy. This
                                process has placed Millions ($ 0,000,000) of Dollars of potential value in the hands of poor people.
                                And, to prove that their participation in “owning a piece of the rock” is real, when a Memberfamily
                                vacates the property, they can cash-out the equity they have earned during their period of
                                occupancy. That, my friend, is the real value of the “American Dream”,</p>

                            <p>The record appears to indicate that most of the multi-family housing communities recently
                                developed have an occupancy ratio of about three (3) adult men and twenty (20) minor children
                                to every ten women. Jobs Build America has been reasonably successful in locating employment
                                opportunities for both male and female adults who want to work.</p>

                            <p>One of our joint venture partners, Waste Management LLC, has discovered how to convert “waste
                                plastic” into a liquid energy strong enough to power an automobile. The company is currently
                                searching for appropriate locations to set-up its’ factories. Waste Management will be an
                                important employer and trainer of persons with undeveloped or under-developed skills who may
                                be residents or neighbors of any new cooperative organized by CCH/TCI and associates. Waste
                                Management has committed to creating dozens of new jobs, hopefully, within walking distance of
                                each new project organized by CCH/TCI and associates.</p>
